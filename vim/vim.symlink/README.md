dotvim
======
*author: Lucas Stephanou*

I use this repository to keep my computers always in sync.

Feel free to use it as you want, my .vimrc is almost completely commented about each configuration.

Most of it is for python and ruby programming, so make sure to tune some options for your use.

Install
-------

I think that a sane way is to just clone this repo and then:

    ln -s ~/dotvim ~/.vim

    ln -s ~/dotvim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

Plugins
-------

I use pathogen for installing plugins, colors, syntax, etc.
So almost everythin is in bundle/ dir

Here is a updated list of plugins I'm using:

- Pathogen
- Badwolf (color scheme)
- CoffeScript
- Ctrlp
- Easymotion
- Fugitive
- Git
- Headlighs
- Javascript
- Markdown
- NERDTree
- Numbers
- Powerline
- Rails
- Rainbow Parenthsis
- Ruby
- Scss
- Sparkup
- Supertab
- Surround
- Syntastic
- Tcomment
- Trailing Whitespace

Thank you
